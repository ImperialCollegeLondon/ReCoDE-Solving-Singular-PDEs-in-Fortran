# 03-3. FPM Settings

Here we configure the compiler and FPM settings in the file `fpm.toml`.


## Explanation of File Contents

```
name = "PDE_Solver"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "license"
author = "Elliot James"
maintainer = "ejb321@ic.ac.uk"
copyright = "Copyright 2024, Elliot James"
```

Here we configure general build settings in the fpm.toml file. Of particular importance to us is linking blas and lapack to FPM using the link variable.

```
[build]
auto-executables = true
auto-tests = true
auto-examples = true
module-naming = false

# adds lapack and blas packages
link = ["blas", "lapack"]
```

The following instructs FPM not to install the package as a library.

```
[install]
library = false
```

The following are standard Fortran settings.

```
[fortran]
implicit-typing = false
implicit-external = true
source-form = "free"
```

The following settings allows FPM to utilize openmp. Although we haven't explicitly parallelized anything in our code, external packages can often use openmp to enhance runtime execution speed.

```
[dependencies]
openmp="*"
```

The options below sets the name of the executable to be created by FPM.

```
[[executable]]
name = "PDE_Solver"
```

The options below allows us to use the `test-drive` framework to set up and execute testing routines.

```
[dev-dependencies]
test-drive.git = "https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive"
test-drive.tag = "v0.4.0"
```

The options below link the directory `src` to FPM. This enables FPM to read the `.f90` files in `src`. The `build-script` variable allows the specification of complier settings.

```
[library]
source-dir="src"
#build-script=" "
```
