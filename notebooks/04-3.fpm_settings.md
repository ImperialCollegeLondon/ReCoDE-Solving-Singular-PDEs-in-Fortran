#04. Running the code

Here we will discuss how to run and edit the code. More specifically we address the compiler/FPM settings.


### 'fpm.toml' Explaination

```
name = "PDE_Solver"
version = "0.1.0"
license = "license"
author = "Elliot Jmaes"
maintainer = "ejb321@ic.ac.uk"
copyright = "Copyright 2024, Elliot Jmaes"
```

Here we set general `build` settings. The most important for us are linking `blas` and `lapack` to FPM in the `link` variable.
```
[build]
auto-executables = true
auto-tests = true
auto-examples = true
module-naming = false

# adds lapack and blas packages
link = ["blas", "lapack"]
```

This instructs FPM not to install the package as a library.
```
[install]
library = false
```
Standard Fortran settings.
```
[fortran]
implicit-typing = false
implicit-external = true
source-form = "free"
```
This lets FPM use `openmp`. Even though we have no parallesied anything explictly, often external packages can use `openmp` to speed up runtime execution.
```
[dependencies]
openmp="*"
```
Setting the executable name.
```
[[executable]]
name = "PDE_Solver"
```
Enables us to use the `test-drive` subroutine to set up the testing subroutines.
```
[dev-dependencies]
test-drive.git = "https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive"
test-drive.tag = "v0.4.0"
```
Link the directory `src` to FPM. This enables FPM to read the `.f90` files in `src`. The `build-script` varaible allows you to specify complier settings.
```
[library]
source-dir="src"
#build-script=" "
```
