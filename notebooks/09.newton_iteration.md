# 09. Newton Iteration

 - ### Step 3:
    We then add in the non-linearities, by including the non-linear function $F$:
       $$\epsilon A(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C(x) u + F(u) = D(x). $$
    This is solved via Newton-Iteration, discussed in ----. 

    This is achieved in the module `Newtons_method.f90` and additionally in the subroutine `non_linear_setup` in the module `equations.f90`.
