#10. Example Equations 

Here we give some example equations. The `definitions.f90` and `settings.input` are given in `solver/examples`, however try to recreate these results yourself.


## Equation 1: [Singular Pertubation Boundary Value Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_perturbation)

Use the code to solve the equation

$$ \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -1, \quad u(0) = 1,\quad u(1) = 3$$

This is a linear equation in one dimension. The general solution is given by
$$u(x) = 1 + x + \frac{e^{x/\epsilon}-1}{e^{1/\epsilon}-1}. $$ 

- Without grid streching, solve this equation in the cases of $\epsilon = 1,0.01$ and $0.001$ with $n_x=10$ as the number of grid points. 
- What happens in the region past $x>0.8$ as $\epsilon$ gets smaller?
- Use grid streching to cluster more points closer to end point $1$ of the domain in the cases of $\epsilon = 1,0.1,0.01$ and $0.001$. What can you conclude?

## Equation 2: Non-linear time dependent equation

Use the code to solve the equation

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + (1-u)u, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(t,0) = 0,\quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(t,1) = 0$$ 
for the solution $u:=u(t,x)$ with initial conditions 

$$ u(0,x) = \cos ^2(2 \pi x) $$ 

on time domain $[0, 1]$. 

There are two interesting behaviours that occur from the solution:
1. First the solution becomes constant very rapidly. This is due to the diffusive term $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$.
2. Seconly, the solution tends to $1$. This is beacuse of the non-linear term $(1-u)u$: the time dependent equation is given by

  $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + (1-u)u$$

  and as $u$ becomes constant the term 
  $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$ 

  becomes zero. We are left with 

  $$(1-u)u = 0$$

  with the solution $u=1$ being an [attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_portrait#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20phase%20portrait,portrait%20of%20a%20simple%20pendulum.) *i.e* the solution $u=1$ is dominante over $u=0$.

## Equation 3: Predator-Prey Model:

Attempt to solve the following:

  $$\epsilon (\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}) + u(1-u) - v\frac{u}{1+u} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \quad  (\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}) + v\frac{u}{1+u} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial t},$$
on the domains $0\leq x\leq 1$ and $0\leq t \leq 0.5$ where 
$\epsilon = 0.05$. Use Dirichlet boundary conditions and the initial conditions

$$u(0,x) = e^{-x^2}\cos^2(4\pi x)$$

$$v(0,x) = e^{(x+0.8)^2}(0.2 + 0.1\sin(10\pi x)^2 $$.

### Exercise:
- How do the initial conditions change the behaviour of the predator and prey?
- Can you set up the system so that the prey die off?


## Equation 4: [Turing Patterns](https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/21_turing.html)

Attempt to solve the following:

  $$\epsilon (\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}) - u + u^2v = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \quad  (\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}) + \mu*(1.d0-u^2 v)  = \frac{\partial v}{\partial t},$$
  
on the domains $0\leq x\leq 20$, $0\leq y\leq 20$ and $0\leq t \leq 10$ where 
$\epsilon = 0.05$ and $mu = 1.8$,
with Dirichlet boundary conditions

$$ \frac{\partial u }{\partial x} (t,0,y) = \frac{\partial u }{\partial x}(t,5,y) = \frac{\partial u }{\partial y}(t,x,0) = \frac{\partial u }{\partial y}(t,x,5) = 0$$

$$ \frac{\partial v }{\partial x}(t,0,y) = \frac{\partial v }{\partial x}(t,5,y) = \frac{\partial v }{\partial y}(t,x,0) = \frac{\partial v }{\partial y}(t,x,5) = 0 $$

and intial conditions given by

$$ u(0,x,y) = 1 + 0.01(2r-1), \quad v(0,x,y) = 1$$ 

where $r$ is a random number between $0$ and $1$. Be careful with the number of spatial grid points; as we are in two dimensions the sizes of the matrices get huge very quickly. We used $n_x=n_y=20$.

Hint: use the following intristic functions for `r`

      Call random_seed()
      Call random_number(r)

We note that for this particular problem, the small parameter $\epsilon$ that multiplies the second derivaties in the first equation does not cause a boundary layer to form in the PDE. Instead, the pattern made by $u$ will be less diffuse than the pattern made by $v$ all across the domain.
