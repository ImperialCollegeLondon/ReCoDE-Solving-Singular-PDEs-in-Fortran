## Mathematical Background

In applied mathematics, partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to describe the development of physical phenomena. 
Frequently these PDEs may incorporate a small parameter, that scale some of the terms in the equation. 
If these terms are important then the presence of this small parameter may be critical; setting the parameter to zero can fundamentally alter the nature and behavior of the equations. 
A notable example is the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes equations, which balances viscous and momentum terms. When the Reynolds number is small, viscous forces predominate, allowing the momentum terms to be neglected. Conversely, when the Reynolds number is large, momentum forces dominate. However, it is not possible to completely neglect the viscous terms, as high Reynolds number flows near boundaries create very thin, highly viscous regions known as [boundary layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_layer).
Such equations are called [singularly perturbed equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_perturbation). For a simple example of this phenomea, see example 1 in `10.example_equations.md`.

In this exemplar, we will develop a partial differential equation (PDE) solver to address a class of singularly perturbed equations prevalent in mathematical biology, specifically reaction-diffusion systems. 
These systems describe the interactions between two competing agents, such as predator and prey or the interaction of different chemical substances. 
When one agent diffuses more slowly than the other, the system represents a singularly perturbed equation.

Reaction-diffusion systems are renowned for their ability to produce a wide variety of spatial patterns, known as [Turing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern). 
These patterns are hypothesized to be responsible for natural phenomena such as the stripes on zebras, the spots on leopards, and the complex skin patterns of giant pufferfish.

## General Model:

Let $$u := u(t,x,y) \quad \text{and}\quad v := v(t,x,y) $$ represent agent densities which vary in both time $t$ 
and spatial coordiantes $x$ and $y$. Reaction-diffusion systems can then be expressed in the form:
$$\frac{\partial u }{\partial t} = \epsilon \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right) + F(u,v),
\quad 
 \frac{\partial v }{\partial t}=  \left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) + G(u,v), $$
where $\epsilon >0$ is some small parameter and $F(u,v)$ and $G(u,v)$ are given functions. $F$ and $G$ represent reaction terms that may be non-linear. 

For the spatial boundary conditions, we will consider either [Dirichlet boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition) 
or [Neumann boundary conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_boundary_condition).

We will additionally specify [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20and%20particularly%20in,typically%20denoted%20t%20%3D%200),
as an given state to evolve in time. 

## Predator-Prey Model:

In a predator-prey models, $u$ represents the prey density and $v$ the predator density.
We can imagine the prey $u$ as a quantity of deer wandering around an enclosed area, while the predators $v$ are wolves that limit the deer population.
Then $F$ and $G$ may be of the form

$$F(u,v) = u(1-u) - v\frac{u}{1+u},$$

$$G(u,v) = v\frac{u}{1+u}.$$ 

In this context, the first term of $F$, $u(1-u)$, represents the prey density increasing with logistic growth. 
In contrast, the second term in $F$ and $G$ itself represent the predator's response to the prey population, with the understanding that the predator can only consume a limited amount of prey
(see [type II response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_response)). Small $\epsilon$ represents a slowly dispersing prey relative to the predators.

## [Activator-Substrate Depletion Model](https://biocircuits.github.io/chapters/21_turing.html):

The Activator-Substrate Depletion Model is a framework used to describe a specific type of oscillatory behavior observed in biochemical systems.
- Activator $u$: A molecule or substance that promotes or accelerates a particular biochemical reaction or process.
- Substrate $v$: The substance upon which the activator acts, typically being converted into a product by the action of the activator.
Then $F$ and $G$ may be of the form
$$F(u,v) = u^2v  - u,$$

$$G(u,v) = \mu(1 - u^2v).$$ 
The constant $\mu$ qualitatively describes the relative rates of chemical reactions for substrate compared to activator. Small $\epsilon$ represents a activator which slowly disperses relative to the substrate. When $\epsilon$ is small and $\mu$ greater than $1$, Turing patterns may emerge in the solution. 


Here we have an activator - substrate example where the intial conditions have been given as $u(0,x,y)=1+r$, where $r$ is a small amount of random noise and $v(0,x,y) = 1$. Dirichlet conditions were used at the boundaries. (GIF broken??)

## Problem Complexities

This partial differential equation (PDE) is fairly complicated: 
  - ### Coupled Equations: 
    This is a system of coupled equations in both $u$ and $v$; the equations are linked together because the solution of one equation depends on the solutions of the others.
    This interdependence means that you can't solve each equation in isolation, which complicates the solution process.
  - ### Nonlinearity: 
    Typically, the functions $F(u,v)$ and $G(u,v)$ can be non-linear, i.e. of the form $u^2+uv$ or $\sin(u+v)$.
    Non-linear PDEs are much harder to solve both analytically and numerically. We will tackle non-linearities numerically with [Newton iteration](https://hplgit.github.io/num-methods-for-PDEs/doc/pub/nonlin/pdf/nonlin-4screen.pdf).
  - ### Spatial and Temporal Dependencies
    The variables $u$ and $v$ depend on both time $t$ and spacial coordianates $(x,y)$. 
    The equations are first order in time $\frac{\partial u }{\partial t}$: we can address this numerical with [temporal marching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method).
    It is also second order in space $\frac{\partial^2 u }{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u }{\partial y^2}$: this [second order derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_partial_differential_equation) means we must solve these equations at every point in space concurrently.
    This quantity measures diffusion or how $u$ changes around a point relative to the points neighbours.
    To solve this equation numerically we use finite differences. See [this](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDE_Diffusion_Code/blob/main/docs/1-numerics.md) previous exemplar for a introduction to finite differences.
- ### Small parameter $\epsilon$:
    As discussed above, the small parameter $\epsilon$ indicates that the diffusion of $u$ is much smaller than the diffusion of $v$.
    This is dealt with numerically using non-uniform grids that are denser in regions where rapid changes occur and coarser elsewhere.
    The non-uniform grids are mapped to a uniform computational grid which are used to compute the finite differences.
- ### Boundary conditions and initial conditions:
  At a particular boundary $(x_0,y_0)$ of the domain of a problem then: 
    - A Dirichlet boundary condition is one of the form $$u(t,x_0,y_0) = L$$ where $L$ is a constant.
    - A Neumann boundary condition is one of the form $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (t,x_0,y_0) = L$$ where $L$ is a constant.
    - An intial condition is of the form: $$u(t_0,x,y) = f(x,y)$$ where $f(x,y)$ is a given function.
  If we are solving for both $u$ and $v$ then conditions will be given for both.
