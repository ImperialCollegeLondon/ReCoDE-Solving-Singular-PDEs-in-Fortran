# 06. Breaking up the problem

The first step in building any PDE solver is to break the problem down into manageable steps. By breaking down a PDE solver into these steps, the overall process becomes more structured, efficient, and easier to understand. It also facilitates debugging, optimization, and extension. Here, we will break our problem down into its core steps and briefly discuss the techniques used in each step. These steps also form the most important modules in the solver.


Consider the equation discussed in ----,
namely
$$\frac{\partial u }{\partial t} = \epsilon \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right) + F(u,v),
\quad 
 \frac{\partial v }{\partial t}=  \left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) + G(u,v), $$
then we can break this equation down into more managable steps.
