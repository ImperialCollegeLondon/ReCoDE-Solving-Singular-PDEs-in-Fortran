# 06. Breaking up the problem

A critical step in building any large, complex project is to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach not only structures and streamlines the process but also enhances debugging, optimization, and scalability. Additionally, it facilitates the development of versatile and modular code that can address a variety of problems.

For our PDE solver, the aim is to solve equations of the form
$$\frac{\partial u }{\partial t} = \epsilon \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right) + F(u,v),
\quad 
 \frac{\partial v }{\partial t}=  \left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) + G(u,v). $$

 This has a few key steps: 
  ## Step 1: 
  In one spatial dimension $x$, consider the boundary value problem (BVP) with solution $u(x)$: 
        $$A(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C(x) u  = D(x), $$
     where $A(x), B(x), C(x)$ and $D(x)$ are functions. We supplemented this equation with Dirichlet or Neumann bounary conditions.
  ## Step 2:
  We then consider the effect of multiplying the second derivative by a small parameter $\epsilon$:
        $$\epsilon A(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C(x) u  = D(x).$$
  ## Step 3:
  We then add in the non-linearities, by including the non-linear function $F$:
       $$\epsilon A(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C(x) u + F(u) = D(x). $$
  ## Step 4:
  We then add a second equation for $v$:
       $$\epsilon A_1(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B_1(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C_1(x) u + F(u,v) = D_1(x), \quad  A_2(x) \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+B_2(x) \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+C_2(x) u + G(u,v) = D_2(x). $$ This is easy to implement with finite differences: if our discretised solution was originally $u = (u(x_1),u(x_2),...,u(x_n))$ then the new discretised solution gets written in the form $u = (u(x_1),v(x_1),u(x_2),v(x_2),...,u(x_n),v(x_n)).$
 ## Step 5:
 Finally, we include a second spatial domain $y$:
       $$\epsilon A_1(x,y) (\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}) + C_1(x,y) u + F(u,v) = D_1(x,y), \quad  A_2(x,y) (\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}) + C_2(x,y) v + G(u,v) = D_2(x,y).$$ We have dropped the first derivatives here for simplicity.
