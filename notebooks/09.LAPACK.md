# 09. LAPACK

LAPACK, which stands for Linear Algebra PACKage, is a highly regarded software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. LAPACK is widely used in scientific computing and engineering because of its efficiency, reliability, and extensive functionality.

LAPACK routines are optimized for performance through the use of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) for lower-level operations (such as matrix multiplication).

We wish to use LAPACK to solve a linear system in the form $A x = b$ where $A$ is a known matrix, $b$ a known vector and $x$ an unknown vector. One example of a LAPACK solver which achieves this with double precision is [`dgbsvx`](netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/da6/group__gbsvx_ga38273d98ae4d598529fc9647ca847ce2.html#ga38273d98ae4d598529fc9647ca847ce2). By examining the documentation, this LAPACK routine takes many inputs. Consequently, it's useful to write a specialised subroutine for LAPACK calls that have all of these extra inputs already defined. 

Consider the subroutine `linear_algebra.f90: solver_banded_double_precision`. We begin this subroutine with
```
! @param      n_input   Leading dimension of the system
! @param      nband     Second dimension of matrix l
! @param      sub_diag  Number of subdiagonal of l
! @param      sup_diag  Number of superdiagonals of l
! @param      l         Matrix dimension nband * n (matrix)
! @param      rhs       The known rhs (vector)
!
! @return     soln      The solution of the system
!!
   Subroutine solver_banded_double_precision(n_input, nband, sub_diag, sup_diag, l, rhs, soln)
      integer, intent(in) :: n_input, nband, sub_diag, sup_diag
      real(dp), dimension(:, :), allocatable, intent(in)  :: l
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable, intent(in) :: rhs
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable, intent(out)   :: soln
```

These are the only inputs we require on our end. All the terms deined in the documentation for [`dgbsvx`](netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/da6/group__gbsvx_ga38273d98ae4d598529fc9647ca847ce2.html#ga38273d98ae4d598529fc9647ca847ce2) have been directly copied from the website:

```
!! Lapack specific terms - lapack gives the required dimension of each term. Copy from website.
    !! X is soln
    !! B is the rhs
    !! AB is the matrix
    !! Everything else sets the correct settings
    !! Note that in dgbsvx B and X can be a matrices. We however Do not need this

      character*1 ::   FACT
      character*1 ::  TRANS
      integer   ::  N
      integer   ::  KL
      integer   ::  KU
      integer   ::  NRHS
      real(dp), dimension(:, :), allocatable :: AB
      integer   ::  LDAB
      real(dp), dimension(:, :), allocatable  ::   AFB
      integer   ::  LDAFB
      integer, dimension(:), allocatable  ::   IPIV
      character*1 ::   EQUED
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable  ::  R
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable  ::  C
      real(dp), dimension(:, :), allocatable :: B
      integer   ::  LDB
      real(dp), dimension(:, :), allocatable :: X
      integer   ::  LDX
      real(dp)  ::  RCOND
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable  :: FERR
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable  ::  BERR
      real(dp), dimension(:), allocatable  ::  WORK
      integer, dimension(:), allocatable  ::  IWORK
      integer   ::  INFO
```
The next section of code sets our data to the LAPACK data:
```
KL = sub_diag
      KU = sup_diag
      N = n_input
      NRHS = 1

      LDAB = nband
      allocate (AB(LDAB, n_input))
      AB = l

      !! More lapack specific settings (copied from website)

      LDAFB = 2*KL + KU + 1
      allocate (AFB(LDAFB, N))
      allocate (IPIV(1:N))

      EQUED = 'N'

      allocate (R(1:N), C(1:N))

      LDB = N ! Dimension of B
      allocate (B(LDB, NRHS))
      B(:, 1) = rhs

      LDX = N
      allocate (X(LDX, NRHS))
      allocate (BERR(NRHS), FERR(NRHS))
      allocate (WORK(max(1, 3*N)), IWORK(N))
```
The `dgbsvx` call is then made. This is followed by a check on the solution output. This is discussed in the documentation. 
```
 !! X is the output
      Call dgbsvx(FACT, TRANS, N, KL, KU, NRHS, AB, LDAB, AFB, LDAFB, IPIV,&
      &EQUED, R, C, B, LDB, X, LDX, RCOND, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, INFO)

      ! If INFO is not equal to zero, then dgbsvx has failed
      ! Writing messages allows us to determine what has gone wrong
      ! These conditions are from the lapack website

      If (INFO == 0) THEN
      !!! dgbsvx has succeded
      Else If (INFO .LT. 0) THEN
         Write (6, *) 'INFO < 0, dgbsvx, has an illegal input value'
         Write (6, *) 'INFO = ', INFO
         Stop
      Else If ((INFO .GT. 0) .AND. (INFO .LE. N)) THEN
         Write (6, *) 'Matrix l is not invertible'
         Write (6, *) 'INFO = ', INFO
         Stop
      Else If (INFO == (N + 1)) THEN
         Write (6, *) 'Matrix l is alomost singular - be careful with solution'
         Write (6, *) 'INFO = ', INFO
         Stop
      Else
         Write (6, *) 'Something is wrong with dgbsvx'
         Write (6, *) 'INFO = ', INFO
         Stop
      End If

      !! Setting up output and moving it into the soln
      allocate (soln(1:N))
      soln(:) = X(:, 1)

      deallocate (AB, AFB, IPIV, R, C, FERR, BERR, WORK, IWORK, X)
      Return
```
