# 08. Nonuniform Domain


  - ### Step 2:
    We then consider the effect of multiplying the second derivative by a small parameter:
        $$\epsilon A(x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+B(x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+C(x) u  = D(x).$$
One of the correct methods of discretising such a problem is with grid streching; where more points are clustered near the boundary where the singularity lives. The mathematics of this and how this is implemented will be discussed in ----.

    This is all dealt in the module `domain.f90`. We emphasise that to construct a new domain all that needs to be specified in the subroutine `set_up_domain` in `domain.f90` are the domains boundaries, number of discretised points and the grid streching settings. It is therefore easy to define multiple domains if needed.
