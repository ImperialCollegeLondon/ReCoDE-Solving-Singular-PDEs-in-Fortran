# Turing Patterns and Partial Differential Equations

<!-- Provide a short description to your project -->

## Description

This code is part of the Research Computing and Data Science Examples (ReCoDE) project. 
It is a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) solver written in Fortran, designed to tackle both boundary value problems (BVP) and initial boundary value problems (IBVP) with temporal marching.
The solver is versatile, capable of handling problems in one or two dimensions and can solve single equations or pairs of coupled equations. This exemplar highlights the code's useful features, including the use of the Fortran Package Manager (FPM), use of LAPACK and the codes modular nature.
As a practical example, the code addresses a PDE from a predator-prey model, known for producing solutions that feature Turing patterns - the patterns that feature on many animals such as pufferfish. While knowledge of PDEs and predator-prey models is not required, all necessary mathematical concepts will be explained below.

## Requirements

This exemplar is for entry-level researchers with basic knowledge of Fortran syntax. An [Introduction to Fortran Course](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/professional-development/doctoral-students/research-computing-data-science/courses/intro-to-fortran/) 
is available to help you get started.


### Academic

<!-- List the system requirements and how to obtain them, that can be as simple
as adding a hyperlink to as detailed as writting step-by-step instructions.
How detailed the instructions should be will vary on a case-by-case basis.

Here are some examples:

- 50 GB of disk space to hold Dataset X
- Anaconda
- Python 3.11 or newer
- Access to the HPC
- PETSc v3.16
- gfortran compiler
- Paraview
-->

### System

<!-- Instructions on how the student should start going through the exemplar.

Structure this section as you see fit but try to be clear, concise and accurate
when writing your instructions.

For example:
Start by watching the introduction video,
then study Jupyter notebooks 1-3 in the `intro` folder
and attempt to complete exercise 1a and 1b.

Once done, start going through through the PDF in the `main` folder.
By the end of it you should be able to solve exercises 2 to 4.

A final exercise can be found in the `final` folder.

Solutions to the above can be found in `solutions`.

## Getting Started

<!-- An overview of the files and folder in the exemplar.
Not all files and directories need to be listed, just the important
sections of your project, like the learning material, the code, the tests, etc.

A good starting point is using the command `tree` in a terminal(Unix),
copying its output and then removing the unimportant parts.

You can use ellipsis (...) to suggest that there are more files or folders
in a tree node.
