# 00. Fortran Package Manager

The Fortran Package Manager (FPM) is a modern build system and package manager specifically designed for Fortran. 
FPM aims to simplify the process of building and testing Fortran software by providing tools and conventions that streamline these tasks.
We have used FPM to help build our project.

Key Features of FPM:
  * **Easy Project Creation**: FPM makes it straightforward to create new Fortran projects with standardized directory structures and documentation.
  * **Dependency Management**: FPM handles dependencies between Fortran packages, making it easier to include external libraries and manage their versions.
  * **Building and Compiling**: It automates the compilation process, ensuring that Fortran code is compiled with the appropriate flags and settings.
  * **Testing**: FPM supports automated testing, which helps in maintaining code quality and reliability.


## How to install FPM

See [here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/install/index.html) for a guide on how to install FPM. 

## How to use FPM

In order to illustrate the uses of FPM we have created a small program in the repository called `fortran_fibonacci`. In your terminal open this directory. Inside this directory we have a very simple Fortran code built with FPM. The FPM repository was initiated with the command `fpm new fortran_fibonacci` and following the guide [here](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/tutorial/hello-fpm.html). 

To run this program type `fpm run -- N` where `N` is an integer. The program should return the `N`th Fibonacci number.

The structure of the repository is given by
```
├── README.md
├── app
│   └── main.f90
├── fpm.toml
├── src
│   └── fibonacci.f90
├── LICENSE
└── test
    └── check.f90
```
The `README.md` file describes how to set up the program.
The important commands when using FPM are: 
  - `fpm run` which compiles and runs the code
  - `fpm test` which complies and runs the test
  - `fpm help` which prints to screen all the possible FPM commands

The other important file is `fpm.toml`. This file is used to configure various aspects of a Fortran project. See [here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDE-Solving-Singular-PDEs-in-Fortran/blob/main/fortran_fibonacci/fpm.toml) for the structure of this file. 

For now, the important sections are `[fortran]`, which sets the default compiler settings and `[dev-dependencies]` which imports the testing framework.


## Testing

Here is the testing module for the program. It has a module filed with tests, `test_demo`, and a program that calls and runs the tests, `tester`.

Starting with `test_demo`, there are three tests: `test_negative`, `test_0_or_1` and `test_greater_than_1`. All these subroutines have an `error` as an output. The error is calculated with the intrinsic `check`; for example on line `26`, `call check(error, fib(-6), -1)` checks if `fib(-6)==-1` and returns an error if it is not.

These three tests are collected in the subroutine `collect_tests` and included in the `testsuite` unit test. Each `new_unittest(string, test)` has a string input that gets printed to the screen when the test is run, and a subroutine test that only returns an error. 

The program [`tester`](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDE-Solving-Singular-PDEs-in-Fortran/tree/main/fortran_fibonacci/test) then calls the `testsuite` and reports any error it finds.
